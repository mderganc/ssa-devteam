# Scoring Rubric

Used in Stage 2 (Solution Evaluation) and Stage 3 (User Approval) to score solution options.

## Dimensions

| Dimension | Scale | Measures | Example Anchors |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Impact - Quality (Q) | 1-10 | Effect on code quality, reliability, maintainability | 1=negligible, 5=moderate improvement, 10=transformative |
| Impact - Time (T) | 1-10 | Effect on development velocity, time savings | 1=no time impact, 5=saves hours/week, 10=saves days/week |
| Impact - Cost (C) | 1-10 | Effect on operational/infrastructure costs | 1=no cost impact, 5=moderate savings, 10=major cost reduction |
| Impact - Risk (R) | 1-10 | Risk reduction (security, data loss, downtime) | 1=no risk change, 5=reduces moderate risk, 10=eliminates critical risk |
| Effort (E) | 1-10 | Implementation complexity and time | 1=trivial (<1hr), 5=moderate (1-3 days), 10=massive (weeks) |
| Priority (P) | Auto | Urgency ranking | Calculated — see formula |

## Priority Auto-Calculation

Priority = (avg(Q, T, C, R) / E) * normalization_factor

Normalization scales the result to 1-10 range. Higher priority = more impact per unit effort.

## Specific Values Override

When a dimension has a calculable specific value, use it instead of the 1-10 scale:
- Cost: `$2.43/run saved` instead of `C=7`
- Time: `~4hrs/week saved` instead of `T=6`
- Risk: `Eliminates 3 of 5 OWASP categories` instead of `R=8`

The 1-10 score is still provided alongside for comparison across solutions.

## Scoring Table Format

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Impact - Quality | 7 | [specific justification] |
| Impact - Time | 4 | [specific justification] |
| Impact - Cost | 3 | [specific justification or calculable value] |
| Impact - Risk | 8 | [specific justification] |
| Effort | 6 | [specific justification] |
| Priority (auto) | 5.5 | avg(7,4,3,8)/Effort, normalized |

## Scoring Integrity Rules

1. Every score must have a justification in the Notes column — no bare numbers.
2. Scores must be defensible — if the critic challenges a score, the Architect must explain it.
3. Scores across solutions for the same root cause should be internally consistent (e.g., if Solution A effort=3 and Solution B effort=8, the difference should be explainable).
4. After implementation (Stage 6), actual scores are compared against estimates for learning.
